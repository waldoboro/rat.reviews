    style='font-family:Consolas;color:black'>I don’t know why exactly, but
    listening to an album that was the “first” of its kind has always been more
    interesting to me than listening to its magnum opus. Probably because you can
    almost put yourself in a room with the musician, imagining the thought process
    that brought this strange confluence of influences together. These albums are
    usually a lot more playful; unencumbered by genre boundaries, or worries of
    commercial appeal. They can follow whatever strange or silly impulses come to
    their creator’s mind(s).</span></p>

    style='font-family:Consolas;color:black'>Nothing is a better example of this
    than Man Parrish’s 1982 debut album. It’s a pioneering album in the genre of
    “Electro,” but that statement alone doesn’t really do it justice. It came at a
    time when dance music was broadly expanding its horizon. New technology
    advances like the Roland TR-808 meant that electronic instruments weren’t
    merely imitating their analog counterparts. And hip-hop culture was discovering
    a far dirtier, edgier application of the synthesizer than Kraftwerk ever could
    have imagined.</span></p>

    What actually is this? I always assumed it just meant “electronic” with the
    second half of the word cut-off. But no. Lo and behold, Electro is absolutely
    its own thing. It’s come to define the period in the early 80s when funk,
    hip-hop and electronic music converged to create the replacement for disco that
    dance clubs were sorely craving. The most commonly cited example of Electro is
