        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Oh
        geez. This is a tough one, and if I am to be honest I will probably amend and
        revisit this one somewhere down the road. Consider this a smattered bookmark,
        and maybe a first-impression - even if this is an album I am rather familiar
        with. </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
        think a fair and necessary explanation for my approach is that my relationship
        with D’Angelo is in parallel with my relationship with Nina Simon’s work: <i>this
        isn’t for me</i>. I have a mild discomfort while listening to both artists in
        that I am erring on voyeurism…which I feel is summed up nicely in a quote from
        Gerald Mast: “<span style='background:white'>Voyeurism allows us to experience
        all the excitement of disaster, catastrophe, and pain, to witness the most
        horrible human events, without any danger of feeling real pain.”</span></span></p>
        
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
        background:white'>&nbsp;</span></p>
        
        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That
        being said, I think my unfamiliarity with D’Angelo’s catalog and career context
        sends me into this review lacking much of the confidence I would want to really
        formulate a strong opinion. I come to this with weak language, fear of offense,
        and a stomach full of fruit from the tree of discomfort. </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
        album commences with a radio tuning into the sounds of the impending alien
        annihilation, <span style='color:#202122;background:white'>antennæ carefully</span>
        tuning to the opener <i>Ain’t That Easy</i>. The choral verses build a lush
        sound that is driven by a marching bass &amp; drum mix. Wonderfully melodic
        vocal melody, especially on the chorus. The percussive novelties added in are a
        theme that is repeated in the album throughout. The following track contains a
        sample from the film ‘The Murder of Fred Hampton’ - followed by largely
        unintelligible vocals through a somewhat dissonant instrumental. </span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
        Charade </span></i><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>takes
        a more conventional approach with a safe and simple musical delivery throughout
        the piece. <i>Sugah Daddy</i> &amp; <i>Really Love</i> are about as far as I
        usually get through this album. I think they both are such a standard at this
        point they don’t need much critique. I think they only leave room for praise as
        pillars in soul/funk/R&amp;B history. I can’t express more how perfect these
        two tracks really are.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Back
        to the Future</span></i><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
        comes with a poppy yet familiar vibe. The orchestration hangs nicely on the
        backbone: a perfect splash of bitters into a strong highball of strong spirits.
        <i>Till It’s Done </i>gives me a taste of a more gospel influenced songwriting.<i>
        Prayer </i>takes on a darker tone - evident of the highly reverb’d backing
        instrumentation and echoing vocals.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Eh
        - this review gets dry quick without touching on the lyrics. I am sitting in
        front of a feast prepared and cooked by one of the finest musical chef’s and I
        have only touched the side dishes and <span style='color:#434343'>my entree</span><span
        style='color:#666666'> is getting </span><span style='color:#999999'>cold</span>.
        I think I will tap out here. I can’t promise the deep dive this album deserves
        - not out of an impending deadline or drained opinion pool - but rather the
        same 3 lines sent into a thesaurus proceeding the track title in italics. I am
        writing about the sea while ignoring the lush archipelago within. This album is
        fantastic. My ability to convey opinion while cowering in the face of
        bowdlerization is not.</span></p>
