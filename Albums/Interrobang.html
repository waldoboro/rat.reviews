		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>Making history can not be compared to recording it.
		Life itself simply cannot be defined by a single medium. The complexities of
		existence, as experienced through whatever senses are bestowed on whatever
		sentient being, are yet to be replicated. W. Churchill has been cited to have
		said¹ “History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it” - and in a similar
		vein - I intend on recording my own lazy &amp; artless history of
		interpretation. <br>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>And just how does one convey an experience? Writing,
		while historically effective and enduring, only provides pleasure to the organs
		of mind and sight, maybe even the touch if such medium permits. Add some
		creative formatting. Choose a pleasing font. Will this read on a screen as it
		would physical print? And you may ask yourself, “How do I work this?”.  </span></p>

		<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Can
		you believe I used a Churchill quote in the opening paragraph? One dark morsel
		of thought can be found embedded in the reasoning on why Tokyo was excluded
		from the list of possible targets for the debut of nuclear warfare. In one
		instance for context the U.S. dropped over 2,000 tons of incendiary bombs over
		the city within 48 hours alone. Being such an old city of wood and other
		natural materials the attack was effective in simply wiping out much of the
		city’s infrastructure. Some twisted beauty in such a brutal act turning life
		into statistics. How does one measure loss on this scale? You can catalog,
		sure, but so much of what is lost is itself lost: there being exhaustion in
		just what can be taken from a single life. And maybe in a little thought
		experiment of what you are willing to give up for what is important to you
		personally - how does one give an answer before ever feeling the threat of
		having your answer challenged? </span></p>

		<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
		U.S. did not drop atomic bombs on Tokyo much for the reason of there being
		little left to destroy. Some have also pointed to the death of the Emperor
		making surrender more difficult, but for the generals in power their goals were
		less granular and their explanations more simple…and from what I can tell, <i>Spoon
		</i>makes no mention of this within this album.</span></p>

		mention Boudicca, Queen of The Iceni, as <i>Spoon </i>did not throughout this
		album. Nevermind.</span></p>
