		<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Grant
		Lee Buffalo, <i>Fuzzy</i> (1993)<br>
		<br>
		</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>I’ve never been much for the bus. Something about it
		seems like one of the highest forms of commitment one could take in terms of
		transportation. Typically crowded, cramped, confined, your only hope for luxury
		is a bathroom stall located at the back. Yet, for myself, I feel so imbued with
		a passion for travel by rail. Typically crowded, cramped, confined, your only
		hope for luxury on a train is an empty seat next to you. How can two seemingly
		similar vessels of transit provide such a distinctly different experience?
		Well, I am usually one bar below the required confidence to be so decisive but
		I cannot ignore my predilection for </span><i><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Arial Unicode MS"'>❀~charm~</span></i><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
		and, like that of the passenger train, <i>Fuzzy</i> is absolutely saturated
		with it. Built with the salient and recondite elements that forms a
		masterpiece, I can’t help but feel the album is adorned with unspoken arrogant
		and pretentious accoutrement. Aside from one or two tracks, I can’t help but be
		distracted by a desire for Grant Lee Buffalo to take themselves just a little
		less serious (the music videos that accompany the tracklist do not help this
		case).</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>While I would say the band provides a cornucopia of
		themes and styles within folk rock, alt rock, and americana the fruit bearing
		within is of a <s>monochromatic</s> ehhh greyscale variety; the themes are
		mostly that of relationships and lyrical jejune introspection, the style is a
		patchwork of past rock pioneers hewing to the jingoism of the protogrunge
		scene, yet the songwriting and execution is just…<i>divine</i>. Although the
		lyrics seemed to be pulled from the diary of a Cameron Crowe character, album
		artwork being that perfectly besmirched sallow portrait that adorns many
		masterpieces (looking at you <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>), the execution of Grant
		Lee Phillip’s songwriting creates a milieu woven with an enchanting puzzle that
		is as fun to piece together as it is to find all the pieces themselves. </span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>To open the album <i>The Shining Hour </i>rides a
		driving tempo carried by Joey Peters’ brushed drum and delightfully
		entertaining basswork by Paul Kimble, concluded sweetly by an apocalyptic piano
		drop. <i>Jupiter And Teardrop</i> punches in with a page right out of Teenage
		Daydream followed closely by a lugubrious acoustic ballad. The contrasting
		overdriven guitar bathes the song in dynamism and is a delightful welcome to
		the track. Oh, you need a radio single? Look no further than the title track <i>Fuzzy.
		</i>We see this track riding the brakes with a more restrained tempo and a
		delicate vocal delivery that serves one of the most satisfying choruses of the
		decade.</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span lang=EN
		style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Wish You Well </span></i><span
		lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>leaves me mucking through
		the morass looking for the sanctuary within the chorus. I could only describe
		the song as being left too long in the oven, seeming to compile the ingredient
		list from one recipe processed with the baking instructions of another. <i>The
		Hook</i> atones for the harshness of the previous track by bringing a gentle
		cloud of warmth and emotional vibrance that would make even a sunset blush,
		casting the hook needed to drag me out of the aforementioned mud &amp; guck. I
		can’t help but to frolic in the space between the layered acoustic guitar and
		brushed percussion. <i>Soft Wolf Tread</i> provides an experience similar to <i>Wish
		You Well</i> but feeling derived more from a fairy tail than a bad breakup.</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span lang=EN
		style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span lang=EN
		style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Stars ‘n’ Stripes </span></i><span
		lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>opens side B with a ballad
		about digital videography (idk I had trouble following the lyrics on this one)
		building to a dalliance between a slide guitar and a marimba. <i>Dixie Drug
		Store </i>breaks through the carceral persistence of alternative and welcomes
		in a slight southern flavor of urban americana. The vocal delivery is
		complemented with a symphony of instruments slowly festooning the track and
		topped with an intoxicating piano melody. <i>America Snoring</i> struggles as a
		rather generic rock anthem adorned with a vocal elegy for American society. <i>Grace</i>
		provides a slightly subdued sound from the previous track that leads us into <i>You
		Just Have To Be Crazy </i>which, while I appreciate the gentle conclusion, I am
		left just wanting one more sledgehammer to the piano or one more guitar scream
		to leave a more lasting mark.</span></p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>While <i>Fuzzy</i> fits all the makings of a timeless
		album I feel there are some kinks that were purposefully left untouched to
		trade in mass-market palpability for an endearing and evocative sound that
		truly leaves a mark on those fortunate enough to stumble upon this half-buried
		treasure.</span></p>
