		in the Dirt</span></b></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Fruit
		Bats, <i>Mouthfuls </i>(2003)</span></p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>Is this country? That kind of country that isn’t
		allowed to be called country but is country? Guess not because it doesn’t have
		deep vocals or songs about pickups and beer (how controversial)...so I guess
		this is a folk-rock album. Eh, I’ll take it. I didn’t check but it feels like a
		debut album so I’ll say it is. I bet they had an EP before this that people
		pretend to love but has such rough production it’s only value is in the cool
		factor. Is this band even cool? I like the name…probably what kept them from
		going mainstream but then again this music isn’t about being cool it’s about
		having something besides <i>Sea Change</i> to listen to when you’re sad about a
		girl. </span></p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span lang=EN
		style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Rainbow Sign</span></i><span
		lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> brings a delightfully
		indie/Shins-esque warmth with tappy percussion and a plucky vibraphone. The
		track seems to act as a Part I opener for the second track <i>A Bit of Wind</i>.
		Opening with a seamless vocal belting that is oh so satisfying the lyrics
		continue to deliver a preciseness that just massages my brain’s linguistic
		system that only the obsessive nature of Phil Spector could produce. Oh shit,
		he brought his gun into the studio again! Fuck, is that a magnum? No. It’s a
		Mangum. You can tell by the orchestration of particular instruments that put my
		ears in an airplane over the sea, although it truly would take a bit of wind to
		get this next track to lift off after that outro. </span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>The third track <i>Magic Hours</i> comes in with a
		restrained tempo’d acoustic ditty paired with catchy vocals and great
		harmonization. The chorus here is mesmerizing. In line with the album thus far
		the instrumentation and production is just so tasteful: an absolutely wonderful
		listening experience. Is it ruined with the next track? Nope. Eric Johnson (not
		the Cliffs of Dover guy apparently) provides, to me atleast, a song reminiscent
		of the track ‘Creep’ by Stone Temple Pilots but with a less dark cloud above. <i>The
		Little Acorn</i> provides another ballad with fantastic panning synth
		arpeggios. <i>Track Rabbits</i> gives an instrumental intermission with a
		beautiful driving bass and a mellotron that steers the ship into space. Back on
		solid ground <i>Union Blanket</i> gives us a plucky banjo/acoustic intro
		followed by space-dust synth dropped by the spaceship metaphor I came up with
		for the last track (I hope you liked it). Vocals here are a bit more drunk but
		you get some digital claps which oh man do I always appreciate. Fuck this album
		is good. Lovin’ the background synthetic static and there aren’t enough words
		for synthesizers (I feel repetitive). </span></p>

		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><i><span lang=EN
		style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Lazy Eye</span></i><span lang=EN
		style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> ~ what a depressing pile of ~ <i>v
		i b e</i>. Absolutely love its restraint and reverb’d piano. The vocal
		harmonization is phenomenal. One issue with the unstated way I’m reviewing
		these albums is the lack of time to dive into the lyrics themselves. I feel
		once I fall in love with an album the lyrics are what seals the deal for me and
		wow all throughout I am impressed with the lyrics. So tasteful yet something
		that lets me personify life back into the song, maybe I can go on and argue
		here that music itself is a medium that lacks some characteristics but wow did
		I leave this to the last second to write and I’m just vibing out to this album
		dude it’s just so good. Is there even another song? Oh yeah, <i>Slipping
		Through the Sensors</i> is a song about robbing a bank probably, they don’t
		give me many lyrics to work with here.<br>
		<br>
		Yaow, coming up on the end of this album now. <i>Seaweed</i> is another lovely
		ballad but it sounds like a girl is here now with her pretty girl voice. <i>When
		U Love Somebody</i> puts a tiny happy bow on a masterpiece of an album. Wow was
		this a pleasant one: an absolute joy cover to cover. </span></p>
