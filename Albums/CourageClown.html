	<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Courage
		of a Clown</span></b></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Joanna
		Newsom, <i>Ys </i>(2006)</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>In New York I had a roommate who went by a self-given
		military title. He was an NYU film student. Odd bird. Nights when he wasn’t
		watching soccer at the pub down the street, he’d lie on his bed and play with a
		tennis ball. On its face, maybe not so unusual. People do that sort of thing to
		pass the time. Except this guy would bat the ball up and down, never catching
		it, instead pawing at it like a cat. Loudly, obliviously. Always while I was
		trying to proofread a final draft or when I had an important work assignment
		that I was preparing for. Invariably, I’d holler at him to cut it out, and he’d
		just lie there blinking at me, nonplussed, as if I were making a demand on him
		without basis.</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>Joanna Newsom’s music reminds me of my erstwhile
		roommate’s sublimely annoying self-rapture, an episodic, near-fatal immersion
		in a world apart from the one the rest of us are trying to work in. It’s a
		quality cats have in abundance. Auto-possession. So does Newsom.</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>She and her harp function as a single melodic device,
		lilting and meandering, weaving together lovely, if gratuitously lofty, tracts
		of music. <i>Ys </i>is egregiously ambitious. The credits alone evidence this.
		Steve Albini recorded Newsom and her trusty accomplice at The Village in Los
		Angeles. Van Dyke Parks arranged the orchestral bits and co-produced the
		record. Jim O’Rourke mixed it. All of it done in analog. All of it mastered at
		Abbey Road. Not to mention the supporting cast, including legendary wrecking
		crew bassist Leland Sklar and the ever-wry Bill Callahan, whose poignant
		backing vocal on ‘Only Skin’ yields one of the record’s most beautiful moments.
		That track, with its waltzing banjo and free-associative procession, is a
		definite highlight.</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>Of course, this record makes demands on the listener.
		How could it not? The vocal pacing can seem relentless, redundant at times. And
		the songs tend to indulge in the same excesses. Newsom and harp are a
		self-reciprocating force that can reach a kind of ecstatic delirium made
		articulate through Newsom’s brainy schematics and mythic volubility. But the
		harpist’s poetry, while formidable, can become exasperating. She admits that
		she normally writes lyrics after the composition of the music. She also binds
		herself to complicated rhyming patterns. The result can be mawkishly intellectual.
		Like Broadway done by nymph-savants.</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>The album is equal parts sprightly and serious. It
		bounces along with Newsom’s syllabic, topsy-turvy tenor, and it accumulates
		gravity when she gets bassier. ‘Emily’ finds Newsom at her most dynamic. And her
		most theatrical. There are suggestions of vaudeville and Shakespeare here, and
		mountains of alliteration in the lyric (she says so herself: ‘a table being
		ceaselessly set’). ‘Monkey &amp; Bear’ leans further into the cerebral showtune
		conceit. The Parks-administered brass and woodwinds interface nicely with the
		harp on this track, and the underlying narrative, for the steadfast ear and
		fans of Lewis Carroll alike, is an introspective trip. Newsom bares all and
		nothing all at once.</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>The third track, ‘Sawdust &amp; Diamonds,’ is the most
		musically sophisticated of the lot. The jazzy notes here bespeak Joni’s modal
		moods, and Newsom’s delivery is less stagey, more insouciant. A loungy,
		Greenwich Village folk reservedness on this one. A whiff of cigarette smoke and
		the ambient warmth of a stark hot stage lamp obtain. The harpist’s fingering on
		this track is intricately filigreed with her vocal. A fine demonstration of
		Newsom’s obvious brilliance and better judgment overlapping.</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>
		
		<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
		"Times New Roman",serif'>The looping ‘Cosmia’ wraps the record up.
		Unfortunately, the last track reprises much of the overwrought musical theater
		that submerges subtle terrestrial grace in the grandiosity of idea. That said,
		the thrumming culmination of ‘Cosmia,’ marked by increasingly emotional vocal
		repetitions and towering string stabs, gives us a departing flash of the
		extraordinary. I think Newsom, in the gaudily decadent parts of this record, is
		a victim of her own exuberant vision. Where she pulls back ever so slightly,
		she succeeds. I probably won’t return to this record. But that doesn’t prevent
		me from recommending that others listen to decide the merits of <i>Ys</i> for
		themselves.</span></p>
