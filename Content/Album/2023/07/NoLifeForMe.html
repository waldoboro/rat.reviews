<p>21 minutes and 28 seconds cut into 9 tracks on a collaborative album from Nathan Williams (aka Wavves) and Cloud Nothings make up this explosion of an album. Wavves brings the Weezer melodies (though off-key) and Cloud Nothings brings that hard to nail sense of authenticity within the grit of the sandpaper.<br />
<br><br />
The author of this can only assume the ingredient list is as follows—</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1/3 part Wavves’ distorted, overly hook-driven melodies: crush to a fine pulp with mortar &amp; pestle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/3 part Cloud Nothing’s <i>manual-5-speed-transmission-driven</i> rhythm, nailed to the wall without hitting their finger from the hammer once</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1/3 part Bugs Bunny secret formula (find at your local Spam Jam Distributor (the old one))<br />

In a current era where beloved artists like Damon Albert (Blur, Gorillaz) are releasing records where it doesn’t feel like an album at all - but rather a mixtape where every track is produced by Gorillaz/DA &amp; featuring a ‘big name’ … or via the route of the self proclaimed, ‘best super-group ever’ (the least punk thing Jello Biafra never heard), boygenius (Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, and Lucy DacusHard). Nearly impossible to deny the talent within boygenius — but… ego’s still need to wait in line for the ‘loo like the rest of us. I wonder if Ginger Baker &amp; Cream would take on boygenius for the title? Would Audioslave be quietly waiting on the sidelines playing an acoustic version of Cochise, knowing they won all along? Nah. In reality, the HBO ticket for the ‘big fight’ would sell zero tickets, as we all know Wu-Tang Clan was perhaps never labeled a super-group, but as a collective — well… sorry Ginger &amp; Julien Baker. (Weird… any relation?) Anyways, I’ll continue to run the jewels to the finish line here...<br />
<br><br />
<i>No Life for Me</i>, albeit from recent past a la 2015, feels like a rarity. It’s the kind of collab diy punks would dream about in high school where two bands form one band, that actually elevates both groups. But, simultaneously is never referred to (or even acknowledged much what it is beyond A band X B band) a super-group or heralding one artists’ impact over the other. And dare I say, this is my favorite Wavves album — while also my favorite Cloud Nothings.<br />
<br><br />
A (Crazy, yet shineable) Diamond in the Rough. And like this reviewer can’t help but think, a very under-appreciated album. It’s an album you finish before you want to, and then you listen to it again. And then it’s 2:38am and you realize you’re out of beer.</p>
