style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Songs From Lovely Ukraine</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>DakhaBrakha, <i>Light</i> (2010)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>By no means is this your grandmother’s Ukrainian
music. There are aspects of pop here, but it’s certainly not as uncomplicated
as run-of-the-mill pop music. File this one under ‘international’. Although, I
hesitate to use a title so stupid and so unremarkable. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Fortunately for the listener, <i>Light</i> is not
unremarkable. The record mostly avoids the traps that releases in this category
routinely succumb to. The sound of this release is dizzyingly eclectic. Its
eclecticism, however, stops plenty short of contrivance. Thanks be to God. The
buffet-style tackiness typical of many ‘world’ records is not in evidence here.
What we have, rather, is a strong assortment of variations on accessible
Western themes as filtered through the techniques of skilled Ukrainian musicians.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>The vocal delivery on ‘Tjolky’ could be mistaken for
something blasted from a stereo in a slammed-to-the-street cutlass in east Los
Angeles. ‘Karpatskyi Rap’ employs the trusty boom-bap rhythms of classic hip
hop with verses punctuated by emphatic ‘woos’ and ‘yeahs’. Much of the sonic
fare in <i>Light</i> is quite familiar to the ears of the contemporary Western
listener. Only the noises are being produced by a group of especially talented
Ukrainians in peculiar garb. Three indefatigable ladies in tall bearskin hats
and a hundred pounds of beads draped round their necks, and an
accordion-playing man in a tailcoat and riding boots. Like Lady Gaga, it looks
way weirder than it is. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>The record opens with ‘Sukhyi Dub’, a sauntering,
Waitsian track featuring male vocals barked through a loudspeaker and female
sing-talking. The cello parts, both fingered and bowed, give the track an
ominous, carnivalesque vibe. If you hate clowns or hairy women, steer clear.
Then comes ‘Specially for You’, another darklit track. This time, Marko
Halanevych begins in his sweet, slightly off-kilter falsetto. There’s a gradual
intensification in the arrangement, and the once gentle vocal turns guttural.
The track builds to a fever pitch that lasts only a few bars but pays off handsomely.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>The songs in this collection that affect the listener
incorporate the same fundamental units: delicate tripartite harmonies brought
into relief by simple rhythms and the complementary pulse of Nina Garenetska’s
cello and Halanevych’s accordion. <i>Light</i> is, all in all, a good,
sometimes great, record. With the exception of the final two tracks. These
dawdle and dawdle and will doubtless test the attention of an unmotivated
listener. Outweighing these soporifics are two really exceptional tracks. ‘Kolyskova’
and ‘Baby’. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>The former has a circular structure that gently
gathers momentum, turn by turn upon itself. The track is graced by a trebly
piano bathed in soft reverb. I think I can hear all four members lending vocals
to this one. The female parts give the impression of a bird call, at key points
echoing to and fro, from the left to right channels of the mix. The rueful
refrain, ‘a time to laugh and a time to cry/a time to live and a time to die’<i>,
</i>has a Byrdsy ring to it. Kind of like a ‘Turn, Turn, Turn’ kumbaya hippie
monism thing going on. I can dig.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Baby’ is a special track. The instincts of the herd
are on point. If you want to experience this song as it ought to be
experienced, find a live performance. Really. The studio recording is gorgeous,
but it helps to peep the actual physical life conjuring this piece into
spacetime. Halanevych sings the ‘baby, show me your love’ part in his oddball
falsetto. He’s backed by the three queens, who make a damn persuasive gospel
choir.  There are poignant bits of electric guitar on this track, and
harmonica. Both are subtle but spacious, giving the track a certain Lanois-era
Dylan timbre. In my estimation, the constituents of this track shouldn’t jibe
but they do. After Halanevych’s part the gals bust into sung-recited verse à la
M.I.A. Their part swirls and ascends and keeps ascending. Add in a short
breakdown midway through the track. Rinse and repeat. ‘Baby’ is sublime.
Definitely worth the price of admission.  -Josey</span></p>
