<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Milo,
<i>So The Flies Don’t Come </i>(2015)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>First impressions are everything. The title of this
record? Dope. Works equally well for a hardcore release. Something by a group
whose name has to do with mutilation or bodily decay. <i>So The Flies Don’t
Come </i>is the sophomore effort of laid-back rhymesmith Milo, who now works
primarily under the R.A.P. Ferreira moniker. This one is a highly (and
refreshingly) coherent body of ciphers executed with studied insouciance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Ferreira’s raps are internally taught but retain a
rhetorical ambivalence and academic jadedness that gives his work a detached
character. For all his aloofness, Ferreira still has the power to transmit an
emotional narrative. See ‘Re: Animist,’ where Kenny Segal’s reservedness as a
producer is the only thing that comes between Ferreira and trap music. Or
‘Going No Place,’ where Ferreira’s rhetorical fury is displayed against a
minimalist canvas of looping chamber strings, hardly detectable cymbal hits,
vinyl static, and a tactically punctual handbell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>It’s impossible to discuss this release without giving
due consideration to Segal’s production. The subtlety is impressive. He’s got a
mature sensibility. Less is more with Segal, such that every fixture of the
sonic landscape has definite presence. And each song works both solitarily and
as a piece of a greater whole. Pick any two songs and they’ll probably line up.
The album can be reorganized in a number of ways and it still makes sense.
That’s got to do with Segal’s style, which is deliberately organic, and
Ferreira’s self-aware lyrical command.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>‘Souvenir’ lurches with slacker swagger. Ferreira’s
bars are brainy and ambling. Segal avails himself of what sounds like a warped
sample of 70’s jazz guitar chords and orchestral jabs layered over by hummed
synth-vocal notes. This is the exemplary track on this record. Hemlock’s verses
provide an unsolicited response to Ferreira’s half-baked samurai references. If
you’re a philosophy buff, you’ll appreciate Ferreira’s intermittent nods to
Eastern thought and Nietzschean cynicism throughout. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>The jagged syncopation and synth pattern on ‘True Nen’
provides another interesting musical backdrop for Ferreira and kindred spirit
Open Mike Eagle, whose performance on this track, though brief, overshadows
Ferreira’s. I felt an impulse to switch on Eagle’s 2020 <i>Anime, Trauma and
Divorce </i>but exercised discretion<i>. </i>The next track, ‘Napping Under The
Echo Tree,’ is the most conspicuously spoken word piece on the record. The
verses seem socio-spiritually enlightened. But the song is, like, a
hypertrophied drag. Man. Perhaps in a different setting this one would find a
more appreciative audience. I imagine it looks good on paper. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>The record closes with a voluble homage to Ferreira’s
musical sensei, Busdriver. This is Ferreira at his best. Form and function are
one. The congruity has a profound effect. The material objective organizes this
track. Within the guideposts of an obvious logic (an ‘Ode’) Ferreira is able to
concentrate word and meaning into a common force that, while typically
abstract, reaches the listener in unobstructed fashion. More of that is
happening on recent releases. I’ll zone out to this some other time. Roll on,
Yoshimitsu. -Josey</span></p>
